The source of this library has been modified to work with the multi-font library Adafruit_mfGFX by pkourany - you will need to also download and include the Adafruit_mfGFX library and include in your sketch:

In addition to the Adafruit_GFX and mfGFX functions there is now a gradient fill function which fills the screen with a specified two colour gradient. Use the function as follows:

// fills screen with two colour vertical gradient
tftInstance.fillGrad(24_bit_RGB_colour_1, 24_bit_RGB_colour_2)

// fills screen with two colour gradient - false = vertical, true = horizontal
tftInstance.fillGrad(24_bit_RGB_colour_1, 24_bit_RGB_colour_2, fillOrientationFlag)

*note that the colours are converted from 24bitRGB to 16bit (565) format for this display. 24bit colours are used as an input because these are easier to experiment with on a graphics editer first before putting values into your code. Colours should be declared as HEX values 0x000000 -> 0xFFFFFF where MSB = Red, bytes 3 & 4 = Green, LSB = Blue.

This is a library for the Adafruit ILI9341 display products

This library works with the Adafruit 2.8" Touch Shield V2 (SPI)
  ----> http://www.adafruit.com/products/1651
 
Check out the links above for our tutorials and wiring diagrams.
These displays use SPI to communicate, 4 or 5 pins are required
to interface (RST is optional).

To download. click the DOWNLOADS button in the top right corner, rename the uncompressed folder Adafruit_ILI9341. Check that the Adafruit_ILI9341 folder contains Adafruit_ILI9341.cpp and Adafruit_ILI9341.

Place the Adafruit_ILI9341 library folder your arduinosketchfolder/libraries/ folder. You may need to create the libraries subfolder if its your first library. Restart the IDE

Also requires the Adafruit_GFX library for Arduino.
